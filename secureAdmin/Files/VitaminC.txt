        <h2>Vitamin C</h2>
        <p class="homePageParagraph">
            Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin. It is needed for normal growth and development.
            <br /><br />
            Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. That means you need an ongoing supply of such vitamins in your diet.
            <br /><br />
            Function
            Vitamin C is needed for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of your body. It is used to:
            <br /><br />
            Form an important protein used to make skin, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels
            Heal wounds and form scar tissue
            Repair and maintain cartilage, bones, and teeth
            Aid in the absorption of iron
            Vitamin C is one of many antioxidants. Antioxidants are nutrients that block some of the damage caused by free radicals.
            <br /><br />
            Free radicals are made when your body breaks down food or when you are exposed to tobacco smoke or radiation.
            The buildup of free radicals over time is largely responsible for the aging process.
            Free radicals may play a role in cancer, heart disease, and conditions like arthritis.
            The body is not able to make vitamin C on its own, and it does not store vitamin C. It is therefore important to include plenty of vitamin C-containing foods in your daily diet.
