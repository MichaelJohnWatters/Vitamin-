        <h2>Vitamin B12</h2>
        <p class="homePageParagraph">
            Vitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy.
            <br /><br />
           Vitamin B12 or B9 (commonly called folate) deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of vitamin B12 or folate causes the 
		   body to produce abnormally large red blood cells that can't function properly.
		   <br /><br />
			Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called haemoglobin.
			<br /><br />
			Anaemia is the general term for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of 
			haemoglobin in each red blood cell.
			<br /><br />
			There are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. For example, iron deficiency anaemia, 
			which occurs when the body doesn't contain enough iron.
